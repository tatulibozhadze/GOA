   <h1><center> discord </center></h1>
    <p>Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform which allows communication through voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media and files. Communication can be private or take place in virtual communities called "servers".[note 2] A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of 2021, the service has over 350 million registered users and over 150 million monthly active users. It is primarily used by gamers, although the share of users interested in other topics is growing.[8][9] As of September 2023, Discord is the 35th most visited website in the world with 23.42% of its traffic coming from the United States.[10][11]</p>

    <h2><u>History</u></h2>
    <p>The concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games,[12] and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had founded Guildwork, another social gaming platform. Citron sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million,[13] which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012.[14] Their first product was Fates Forever, released in 2014, which Citron anticipated to be the first MOBA game on mobile platforms, but it did not become commercially successful.[15]

        According to Citron, during the development process, he noticed how difficult it was for his team to work out tactics in games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends using available voice over IP (VoIP) software. This led to the development of a chat service with a focus on user friendliness with minimal impact on performance.[15] The name Discord was chosen because it "sounds cool and has to do with talking", was easy to say, spell, remember, and was available for trademark and website. In addition, "Discord in the gaming community" was the problem they wished to solve.[16]
        
        To develop Discord, Hammer & Chisel gained additional funding from YouWeb's 9+ incubator, which had also funded the startup of Hammer & Chisel, and from Benchmark capital and Tencent.[14][17]
        
        Discord was publicly released in May 2015 under the domain name discordapp.com.[18] According to Citron, they made no specific moves to target any specific audience, but some gaming-related subreddits quickly began to replace their IRC links with Discord links.[19] Discord became widely used by esports and LAN tournament gamers. The company benefited from relationships with Twitch streamers and subreddit communities for Diablo and World of Warcraft.[20]
        
        In January 2016, Discord raised an additional $20 million in funding, including an investment from WarnerMedia (then TimeWarner).[21] In 2019, WarnerMedia Investment Group was shut down and acquired by AT&T, selling its equity.[22][23]
        
        Microsoft announced in April 2018 that it would provide Discord support for Xbox Live users, allowing them to link their Discord and Xbox Live accounts so that they can connect with their Xbox Live friends list through Discord.[24]
        
        In December 2018, the company announced it had raised $150 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation. The round was led by Greenoaks Capital with participation from Firstmark, Tencent, IVP, Index Ventures and Technology Opportunity Partners.[25]
        
        Starting in June 2020, Discord announced it was shifting focus away from video gaming specifically to a more all-purpose communication and chat client for all functions, revealing its new slogan "Your place to talk", along with a revised website. Among other planned changes was to reduce the number of gaming in-jokes it used within the client, improving the user onboarding experience, and increasing server capacity and reliability. The company announced it had received an additional $100 million in investments to help with these changes.[26]
        
        In March 2021, Discord announced it had hired its first finance chief, former head of finance for Pinterest Tomasz Marcinkowski. An inside source called this one of the first steps for the company towards a potential initial public offering, though co-founder and chief executive officer Jason Citron had stated earlier in the month he was not thinking about taking the company public. Discord doubled its monthly user base to about 140 million in 2020.[27] The same month, Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal reported that several companies were looking to purchase Discord, with Microsoft named as the likely lead buyer at a value estimated at $10 billion.[28][29] However, they ended talks with Microsoft, opting to stay independent.[30] Instead, Discord launched another round of investment in April 2021.[31] Among those investing into the company was Sony Interactive Entertainment; the company stated that it intended to integrate a portion of Discord's services into the PlayStation Network by 2022.[32][33]
        
        
        The old Discord wordmark (2015–2021)
        In May 2021, Discord rebranded its game controller-shaped logo "Clyde" in celebration of its sixth anniversary.[34][unreliable source?] The company also changed the color palette of its branding and user interfaces, making it much more saturated, to be more "bold and playful". They also changed its slogan from "your place to talk", to "imagine a place", believing that it would be easier to attach to additional taglines; these changes were met with backlash and criticism from Discord users.[35]
        
        In July 2021, Discord acquired Sentropy, an internet moderation company.[36]
        
        Ahead of a funding round in August 2021, Discord had reported $130 million in 2020 revenues, triple from the prior year, and had an estimated valuation of $15 billion. According to Citron, the increased valuation was due to the shift away from "broadcast wide-open social media communication services to more small, intimate places", as well as increased usage from the COVID-19 pandemic. They captured users that were leaving Facebook and other platforms due to privacy concerns.[37] Citron states that they are still in talks with several potential buyers including all major gaming console manufacturers.[37] From this, the company secured an additional $500 million in further investments in September 2021.[38]
        
        In September 2021, Google sent cease and desist notices to the developers of two of the most popular music bots used on Discord–Groovy and Rythm–which were used on an estimated 36 million servers in total.[39] These bots allowed users to request and play songs in a voice channel, taking the songs from YouTube ad-free. Two weeks later, Discord partnered with YouTube to test a "Watch Together" feature, which allows Discord users to watch YouTube videos together.[40]
        
        Citron posted mockup images of Discord around the proposed Web3 principles with integrated cryptocurrency and non-fungible token support in November 2021, leading to criticism from its userbase. Citron later stated that "We [...] want to clarify we have no plans to ship it at this time."[41]
        
        As of March 2022, Discord employs 600 people globally.[42]
        
        The CNIL fined Discord €800,000 in November 2022 for being in violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations found by CNIL were that the application would continue to run in the background after it was closed and would not disconnect the user from a voice chat, as well as allowing users to create passwords that only consist of six characters.[43]
        
        In early 2023, Discord was used to publish classified United States documents in one of the most significant intelligence leaks in recent history. The documents, distributed on a Minecraft Discord server as photos, detailed the state of the Russo-Ukrainian War, surveillance of allied and adversarial nations, and indicated cracks in alliances with nations aligned with the United States.[44][45][46]
        
        On December 5, 2023, Discord launched a major update of its mobile app, putting messaging front-and-center while making a host of minor improvements[47].</p>

<h2><u>Features</u></h2>
<p>Discord is centered around managing communities. Communication tools such as voice and video calls, persistent chat rooms, and integrations with other gamer-focused services along with the general ability to send direct messages and create personal groups are present.[48]</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>Servers</u></h2>
<p>Discord communities are organized into discrete collections of channels called servers. Although they are referred to as servers on the front end, they are called "guilds" in the developer documentation.[49] Users can create servers for free, manage their public visibility, and create voice channels, text channels, and categories to sort the channels into.[48] Most servers have a limit of 250,000 members, but this limit can be raised if the server owner contacts Discord.[50] The previously largest known Discord server was Snowsgiving 2021, an official Discord-controlled server made for the 2021 winter holiday season. This server reached 1 million members.[51] In 2023, the server for Midjourney reached over 15 million members, making it the largest server on Discord.[52]

    Starting October 2017, Discord allows game developers and publishers to verify their servers. Verified servers, like verified accounts on social media sites, have badges to mark them as official communities. A verified server is moderated by its developers' or publishers' own moderation team. Verification was later extended in February 2018 to include esports teams and musical artists.[53][54][55] By the end of 2017, about 450 servers were verified.[56]</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>Channel Types</u></h2>
<p>Channels may be either used for voice chat and streaming or for instant messaging and file sharing, or both.

    Discord launched Stage Channels in May 2021, a feature similar to Clubhouse which allows for live, moderated channels, for audio talks, discussions, and other uses, which can further be potentially gated to only invited or ticketed users. Initially, users could search for open Stage Channels relevant to their interests through a Stage Discovery tool, which was discontinued in October 2021.[57][58]
    
    In August 2021, Discord launched Threads, which are temporary text channels that can be set to automatically disappear. This is meant to help foster more communication within servers.[59]
    
    Forum Channels, which allow for longer and separate conversations were introduced to the platform in September 2022. These channels bring an Internet forum experience to Discord.[60]
    
    Discord launched Media Channels in June 2023. Media Channels are restricted to videos and images only.[61]</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><u>User Profiles</u></h2>
    <p>Users register for Discord with an email address and must create a username. Until mid-2023, to allow multiple users to use the same username, each user was assigned a four-digit number called a "discriminator" (colloquially a "Discord tag"), prefixed with "#", which was added to the end of their username.[62] Users who subscribe to Discord Nitro have the ability to change this tag to any four-digit number. This system was ultimately changed in May 2023, removing the discriminator from usernames.[63] This new system mandated a change of username. Users criticized the possible impersonation risk that may arise if their previous username was claimed by another user.[64]

        In June 2021, Discord added a feature that allows all users to add an about me section to their profile, as well as a custom colored banner at the top of their profile. Subscribers to Discord Nitro have the added ability to upload a static or animated image as their banner instead of a solid color.[65]</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><u>Video calls and Streaming</u></h2>
    <p>Video calling and screen sharing were added in October 2017, allowing users to create private video calls with up to 10 users,[66] later increased to 50 due to the increased popularity of video calling during the COVID-19 pandemic.[67]

        In August 2019, this was expanded with live streaming channels in servers. A user can share their entire screen, or a specific application, and others in that channel can choose to watch the stream. While these features somewhat mimic the livestreaming capabilities of platforms like Twitch, the company does not plan to compete with these services, as these features were made for small groups.[56]</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><u>Digital distribution</u></h2>
    <p>In August 2018, Discord launched a games storefront beta, allowing users to purchase a curated set of games through the service.[68] This will include a "First on Discord" featured set of games that their developers attest to Discord's help in getting launched, giving these games 90 days of exclusivity on the Discord marketplace. Discord Nitro subscribers will also gain access to a rotating set of games as part of their subscription, with the price of Nitro being bumped from $4.99 to $9.99 a month.[69][70] A cheaper service called 'Nitro Classic' was also released that has the same perks as Nitro but does not include free games.

        Following the launch of the Epic Games Store, which challenged Valve's Steam storefront by only taking a 12% cut of game revenue, Discord announced in December 2018 that it would reduce its own revenue cut to 10%.[71]
        
        To further support developers, starting in March 2019 Discord gave the ability for developers and publishers that ran their own servers to offer their games through a dedicated store channel on their server, with Discord managing the payment processing and distribution. This can be used, for example, to give select users access to alpha- and beta-builds of a game in progress as an early access alternative.[72]
        
        Also in March 2019, Discord removed the digital storefront, instead choosing to focus on the Nitro subscription and having direct sales be done through developer's own servers.[73] In September 2019, Discord announced that it was ending its free game service in October 2019 as they found too few people were playing the games offered.[74]</p>
